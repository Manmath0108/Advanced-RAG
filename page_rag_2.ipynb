    "3. **Keyword Generation** - Generate 5 SEC filing-specific keywords for ranking <br>\n",
    "4. **Filtered Search** - Retrieve documents using metadata filters and content keywords (MMR Search) <br>\n",
    "5. **BM25 Re-Ranking** - Re-rank results using BM25Plus on heading + content chunks to improve relevance <br>"

(One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\\n\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(6.5) billion and $(4.5) billion for Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $(185) million and $(5.7) billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $4.4 billion and $525 million for Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $17.2 billion and $863 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $10.9 billion and $5.0 billion in Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $17.4 billion and $6.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $240 million and $181 million during Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $248 million and $223 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs, and we had $183 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of June 30, 2024. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional information.\\n\\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\\n\\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $3.7 billion and $5.7 billion for Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $4.4 billion and $6.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and $495 million. See Item 1 of Part I, 'Financial Statements - Note 4 - Commitments and Contingencies' and 'Financial Statements - Note 5 - Debt' for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\n\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.' We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\n\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\\n\\n\"),\n",
