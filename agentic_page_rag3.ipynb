Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $1.7 billion in 2024.\\n\\nShipping costs were $89.5 billion and $95.8 billion in 2023 and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\\n\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and infrastructure' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\n\\n## Fulfillment\\n\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com's expectations as of August 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part II, 'Risk Factors.'\\n\\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\\n\\n- Net sales are expected to be between $154.0 billion and $158.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 11% compared with third quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 90 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\\n- Operating income is expected to be between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion, compared with $11.2 billion in third quarter 2023.\\n- This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\\n\\n\\n--- Document 3 ---\\nfiscal_year: 2024\\npage: 5\\nfile_hash: 5b582c59f1d1fa81d5112c9e0b9aa87afdbc9f42418daace257bc360e0f61ef7\\nsource_file: amazon 10-k 2024.pdf\\ndoc_type: 10-k\\ncompany_name: amazon\\n\\nContent:\\n\\n\\n## Available Information\\n\\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $1.7 billion in 2024.\\n\\nShipping costs were $89.5 billion and $95.8 billion in 2023 and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\\n\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as 'Technology and infrastructure' as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\n\\n## Fulfillment\\n\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs.
