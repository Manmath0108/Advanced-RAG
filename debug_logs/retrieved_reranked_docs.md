## General and Administrative

The decrease in general and administrative costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to a decrease in payroll and related expenses.

## Other Operating Expense (Income), Net

Other operating expense (income), net was $767 million and $763 million during 2023 and 2024, and was primarily related to asset impairments and the amortization of intangible assets.

## Operating Income (Loss)

Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):

|                         | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                         | 2023                      | 2024                      |
| Operating Income (Loss) |                           |                           |
| North America           | $ 14,877                  | $ 24,967                  |
| International           | (2,656)                   | 3,792                     |
| AWS                     | 24,631                    | 39,834                    |
| Consolidated            | $ 36,852                  | $ 68,593                  |

Operating income was $36.9 billion and $68.6 billion for 2023 and 2024. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. For more information on the operating expenses that impact segment operating income, see 'Operating Expenses' and the descriptions of operating expense line item changes on pages 25 to 27, and 'Note 10 - Segment Information' on page 65.

The increase in North America operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs.

The International operating income in 2024, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact operating income in 2024.

The increase in AWS operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, decreased payroll and related expenses, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful lives of our servers, partially offset by spending on technology infrastructure that was primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $240 million in 2024.

## Interest Income and Expense

Our interest income was $2.9 billion and $4.7 billion during 2023 and 2024, primarily due to a higher average balance of invested funds at prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.

Interest expense was $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2023 and 2024 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Leases and Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.

Our long-term lease liabilities were $77.3 billion and $78.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our long-term debt was $58.3 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 - Leases and Note 6 - Debt' for additional information.

## Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net was $938 million and $(2.3) billion during 2023 and 2024. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2023 and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $797 million and $(1.6) billion from our equity investment in Rivian.

(1) The related unrealized gain (loss) recorded in 'Other income (expense), net' was $(13.6) billion, $1.0 billion, and $(1.3) billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

(2) We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily as collateral for real estate, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, standby and trade letters of credit, and licenses of digital media content. We classify cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities with use restrictions of less than twelve months as 'Accounts receivable, net and other' and of twelve months or longer as non-current 'Other assets' on our consolidated balance sheets. See 'Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies.'

The following table summarizes gross gains and gross losses realized on sales of marketable debt securities (in millions):

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual maturities of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):
